## Greenframe

Greenframe (https://greenframe.io/) can compute the CO2 footprint of a service based on Docker statistics (https://github.com/marmelab/greenframe-cli/blob/main/src/model/README.md). 
The microservices and their dependencies are executed via `docker-compose`. See the relevant documentation for each of the microservices.
